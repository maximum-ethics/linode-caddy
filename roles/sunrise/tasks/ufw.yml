# It seems ufw can fail if you update the kernel image without restarting the system?
# Rebooting is an easy fix, but pretty annoying for Ansible and our uptime:

# It may be possible to avoid this issue by switching to Linode's latest 64 bit kernel:

# I did so, and so far no problems...

# IMPORTANT: UFW rules remain active until you delete them, so simply removing

# as demonstrated below.
