make an inventory file at '/etc/ansible/hosts' (or /usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts if you use homebrew on Mac to install Ansible) with the following contents:
[sunrise]
attenborough

[local]
localhost

[local:vars]
pass_attenborough=[get the pass over signal (for now)]
ssh_pub_key=[PASTE YOUR OWN PUBLIC KEY]
sunrise_linode_token=[PASTE YOUR OWN LINODE API TOKEN]

run:
# to create the Linode server from your computer by connecting to the Linode API
ansible-playbook linode_create.yml --ask-become-pass
# to change your password from our default, so you can log in as yourself
ssh attenborough
# to set up the server
ansible-playbook sunrise.yml

# WAIT! If you are changing the IP address for an existing domain name, consider the TTL
# Linode's default TTL is 24 hours:
# https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/manager/dns-manager/#troubleshoot-dns-records
# Many of our Godaddy subdomains currently have the TTL set to 1 hour.
# If you power up your new Caddy webserver before DNS resolves correctly,
# it won't be able to get certificates from Let's Encrypt, and won't serve your websites.
# Worse, you may annoy Let's Encrypt by exceeding their rate limits
# (requesting certs you can't get) and then you'll have to wait even longer!
# Make sure the domain resolves to the correct IP address before setting up Caddy.

# to install the Caddy v2 webserver

# to install RI's handcoded PHP website
